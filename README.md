# CropPrediction_DiseaseDetection
Yield prediction &amp; disease detection is important for Pakistan government as well as individual farmer. Currently no automated system is available in Pakistan to predict the yield &amp; disease detection. We are created a system for crop prediction and disease detection of rice. We used the machine learning techniques and IOT sensors in our project.
